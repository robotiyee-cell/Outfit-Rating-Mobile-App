# 👗 Looks 4 Fun  
### AI-Powered Fashion Evaluation & Outfit Rating App  

**Platform:** iOS (TestFlight)  
**Category:** Fashion · Lifestyle · AI Assistant  

---
## 🎯 Purpose  
Practice project exploring how AI-assisted tools can accelerate mobile app creation while focusing on real user experience design.

---

## 🧠 Concept & Design  
**Looks 4 Fun** is an intelligent mobile application that helps users evaluate, rate, and analyze their outfits using AI-driven fashion insights.  

The project was **inspired by personal needs** for quick, data-driven fashion feedback.  
I used **Rork**, an AI-based tool for automated mobile app generation, and then **personally designed the user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** to ensure an engaging, intuitive flow.  

Users can upload or take a photo, select a clothing category, and tap **“Evaluate My Outfit”** — the app instantly analyzes the look based on style, color harmony, and trend relevance.  
It can also identify which **brand or designer**  a specific outfit resembles, helping users make smarter wardrobe and shopping decisions.

## 💬 Prompt Engineering & AI Workflow  
This project was conceptualized and built using **AI-assisted development workflows**.  
I personally **designed and refined the prompts** that guided the Rork AI tool in generating the mobile app structure, component logic, and UI flow.  
This process demonstrates the ability to apply **prompt engineering techniques** to achieve desired design and functionality outcomes.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development Approach  
*(No AI chat logs stored — only process documentation.)*

Development followed a **hybrid AI-assisted + manual engineering** workflow.

### 🔹 1. Rapid App Scaffolding  
Rork generated:
- initial folder & file structure  
- navigation boilerplate  
- basic screen templates  
- foundational UI components  

This accelerated setup while maintaining full manual control.

### 🔹 2. Iterative UI/UX Refinement  
I refined:
- fashion-oriented pink/purple visual palette  
- editorial result layout  
- spacing & typographic hierarchy  
- animated score reveal components  
- reusable card-based UI system  

AI-generated layouts were iterated and finalized manually.

### 🔹 3. Prompt Design for Fashion Evaluation  
Since no chat logs exist, prompt design is expressed as **backend specifications**, not dialogues.

- Outfit history and style score tracking
